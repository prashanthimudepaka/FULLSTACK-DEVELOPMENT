//the "for...of" loop javascript is a modern iteration statement introduced in es6
//that provides a concise and easy way to loop over elements in iterable objects like arrays,
//strings, maps, sets, and more. It allows you to iterate directly over the values of the
//elements, rathr than dealing with their indices or keys, which makes the code more readable and less 
//error-prone

//for(variable of iterable)
// let peoples=["prash",'alex',"john","brad"]
let peoples="hello"
for(const people of peoples)
{
    console.log(people)
}
